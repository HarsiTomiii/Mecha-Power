This was a gamejam submission where the theme was "power"

In the game you need to mine resources, you have to deposit that into a refinery and that generates power for the base. Then you can recharge yourself from the generated power at the recharge station.
The goal is to destroy the alien mothership.

Some things I built in a way that it could be scaleable, and balancing is not well done currently, but i was restricted on time how much I can develop, so it is half-baked in every sense :)
